## WIP

### Architecture 
Simple VIPER pattern with separate models for presenter/view, interactor and repository layers. (It's a hard way but worth a trouble)  
Google map enhanced with **android-maps-utils**.  
**RxJava2** with **RxKotlin** on board.  

### Testing
Used libraries: **Mockito**, **kotlin-mockito**, **JUnit**.  
For test coverage **JaCoCo** with exclude filters for views and data model
